# pfp-nqueens:  Parallel N-Queens in Haskell

This is a series of Haskell implementations of Niklaus Wirth's
backtracking depth-first solver of the [n-queens
problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle).  These
range from a simple list-based implementation to a parallel
implementation that uses Haskell's parallel strategies.

This illustrates the sort of parallelization and optimization
aimed for in the "Parallel Functional Programming" class
taught at Columbia University.

`nqueens.pdf`
: The report

`nqueens.lhs`
: The literate Haskell program for the report, which includes all the code.
This file can be compiled both by LaTeX and the Haskell compiler GHC.

`Makefile`
: Rules for generating the PDF report file,
formatting the raw experiment logs (.out and .rts files) into
something suitable for LaTeX or TikZ (using AWK scripts), and
compiling the executables using the
[Haskell Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/).
`make` by itself will print a list of targets.

`nqueens`
: Bash script for running all the experiments.
It is set up to be run on a variety of hosts to test how it responds
across systems with different resources.  It can be directed to run
some or all of the experiments intended for a host.  Try `./nqueens -h`

`ford/` `zaphod/` `zaphod4/`
: Directories containing experimental data generated by the `nqueens`
script collected on the machines mentioned in the report.

`lscpu.txt` `lsmem.txt`
: In the experiment directories, detailed information about the machines
used to run the experiments. The `nqueens` script generates these.

I developed this under Ubuntu Linux; it may also work under MacOS and Windows.
