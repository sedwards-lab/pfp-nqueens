# pfp-nqueens:  Parallel N-Queens in Haskell

This illustrates the sort of parallelization and optimization
you should aim for in the "Parallel Functional Programming" class
taught at Columbia University. <https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~sedwards/classes/2025/4995-fall/index.html>

`nqueens.pdf` is the report, which includes all the code.  This is a
literate program: `nqueens.lhs` can be compiled both by LaTeX and the
Haskell compiler GHC.

The `Makefile` includes rules for generating the PDF report file,
formatting the raw experiment logs (.out and .rts files) into
something suitable for LaTeX or TikZ (using AWK scripts), and
compiling the executables using the [Haskell
Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/).  `make` by
itself will print a list of targets.

`nqueens` is a bash script for running all the experiments.
It is set up to be run on a variety of hosts to test how it responds
across systems with different resources.  It can be directed to run
some or all of the experiments intended for a host.  Try `./nqueens -h`

The `ford/` `zaphod/` and `zaphod4/` directories contain experimental
data generated by the `nqueens` script collected on the machines
mentioned in the report.  In each directory, `lscpu.txt` and
`lsmem.txt` contain detailed information about each host's processor
and memory, which the `nqueens` script generates.

I developed this under Ubuntu Linux; it may also work under MacOS and
Windows.
